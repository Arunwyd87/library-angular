# Building an Angular Library with multiple entry points

This repo is a demo of creating an Angular library with multiple entry points and a showcase app. Please read my blog post about this topic:

[sandroroth.com/blog/angular-library](https://sandroroth.com/blog/angular-library).

_Note: The components in this project are only for demo purposes. Never ever build a button component this way!_

## Angular version

The project was initially generated with Angular 14 and
has been updated to Angular 15. If you create a new project with Angular 15+,
your setup will look a bit different (e.g. there is no `test.ts` file anymore).
Just follow the instructions in the blog post. Any relevant differences between Angular 14 and 15+ are mentioned in the blog post.
